\chapter{The Standard Deviation}
\begin{definition}[Standard Deviation]\label{def:standard_deviation}
    The extent to which the data are spread out from the mean, described as:
    \[
        S=\sqrt{\frac{\sum(x-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}
    \]
\end{definition}
\section{Error}
The standard deviation error bars on a graph can be used to get a sense for whether a difference is significant. Overlap can show that the difference is not statistically significant.
\begin{definition}[Standard Error of the Mean (SEM)]\label{def:standard_error}
    Measures how far the sample mean of the data is likely to be from the true population mean.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Always smaller than the Standard Deviation
        \item Shows how accurate your estimate of the mean is likely to be
    \end{itemize}
    \[
        \sigma_{\bar{x}}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
    \]
\end{definition}
